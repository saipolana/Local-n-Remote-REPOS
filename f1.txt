Execute the cherry pick command
git cheppry-pick: It is a git command which is used to get a specific commit or whole branch commits to our branch.
git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.

Now we execute stash command in real.
